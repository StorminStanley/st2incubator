Voodoo Pack Creator
=====

#### Introduction
This utility was created to generate StackStorm integration packs from python package or module.  It will generate the meta data for all methods or functions in the package/module and provides a basic python script to be used as the entry point, as well as a basic library for invoking the actions.  Most packs generated from this utility will require customization to the action.py library to make all actions work correctly.
